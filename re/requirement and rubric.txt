Task overview

Each individual is to submit a Reflection Report. The main goal of the Reflection Report is to reflect on your individual and team experiences during the project (Week 1 - Week 12). The audience for the Reflection Report is internal/external and will be used by the Project Principal/facilitators to provide Summative feedback to you. This report does count towards your final grade. The task requirements can be found here.

The report should be submitted to Turnitin via the appropriate link on Canvas. Note that Canvas and Turnitin may sometimes have outages beyond our control, so it is wise not to leave submissions to the last minute – you can overwrite previous submissions.

Project report

Each individual team member is to submit a final project report. 

You should work on this document after you have completed the Project Brief and the presentation. Remember this is your final assessment which allows us to read through your project progress, so use full sentences and avoid jargon and abbreviations. The Final Report should contain the following. 

Use the following structure in the document, which includes:

Project reflection 

[Reflection is a useful way of making sense of what you have learned. It can also help you to identify strategies that worked or didn’t work and encourage you to identify better ways to do things next time. In this task, you are asked to provide a reflection on the process of working on the project for COS70008.

Group Work Reflection [In this section, refer to events (week 2 – week 11 group activities) and people specific to your group (i.e., avoid the use of 'we/he/she' in this discussion, instead refer to your group members by name, do not list general guides/recommendations for group work)]

    Describe the group work strategies/processes that worked for your team.
    Describe the group work strategies/processes that did not work for your team.
    Describe what could be improved next time you work in a group. This should be from your individual perspective, e.g., "not working with person X" is not something you can change.
    Describe an event/action (add evidence) in your team (i.e., not just from you) that you think was outstanding with respect to each of the:
        Team organisation
