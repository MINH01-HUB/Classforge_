    Execute the GAT model for classroom allocation.
    
    This endpoint processes a request to run the Graph Attention Network model,
    which analyzes student relationships and generates optimal classroom assignments.
    The model takes into account various factors that can be weighted using sliders
    from the frontend interface.
    
    Request Body:
        {
            "sliders": {
                "academic_weight": float,  # Weight for academic performance
                "wellbeing_weight": float, # Weight for student wellbeing
                "friendship_weight": float,# Weight for maintaining friendships
                "conflict_weight": float,  # Weight for avoiding conflicts
                ... (other optional weights)
            }

                "total_students": int,     # Number of students processed
                "total_relationships": int,# Number of relationships in the graph

            "status": "error",
            "message": str  # Error details
          }
    
    Note:
        The model execution is resource-intensive and may take some time to complete.
        The frontend should handle this appropriately with loading indicators.
